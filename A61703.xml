            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> Thus eminent, thus popular, thus potent an Agent and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of all the <hi>Independent</hi> Party has W. H. rendred himſelf, which if true, their Cauſe muſt needs be concluded in him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtand or fall with him. But being cloſely urged in our laſt ſheet againſt him, <q>
                  <q rend="margSglQuotes">To produce his Deputation for this his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking againſt us under the hands of ſome of the chief Paſtors of the <hi>Independent</hi> Congregations, or otherwiſe we ſhall abſolutely look upon his Work as the Fruit of his own ſilly Preſumption and Uſurpation:</q> as we had cauſe ſo to do ſince he bragg'd ſo loud, and ſo lively undertook to perſonate all the <hi>Independent</hi> Party in <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> But inſtead of producing ſuch Deputation, he gives us this put off, viz. <hi>My Deputation for this Work is from the Word of Chriſt,</hi> Jud. 3. <hi>I need no other Deputation,</hi> p. 8. of his ſheet Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Whereas any Counterfeit may pretend the ſame from others Lines; an immediate Miſſion he pretends not for his Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; he comes off after a ſorry and beggarly manner here; what's this to his approbation from his <hi>honourable Party,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> whom he has taken on him to repreſent and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? but we thought they were wiſer then to truſt their Cauſe in his Hands or Management; therefore how plain is it, that his Work againſt us in his ſeveral Books and Pamphlets, is a Fruit of his own ſilly preſumption and uſurpation, and that he is but a Counterfeit Agent, who appears to repreſent ſuch an <hi>honourable Party,</hi> as he calls them, and not ſo much as two or three of thoſe moſt honourable among them dare truſt him with their Cauſe, or adventure to own him in print; 'tis probable the wiſer ſort of them alſo look upon Him to be a preſumptuous Buſie-Body, except ſome of his prejudiced Hearers, Benefactors, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Note alſo, that we referr'd him for a more full Anſwer (to the Subſtance of his Book) then we have given about <hi>Chriſt's manhood,</hi> entituled, <hi>The Way Caſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>George Keith:</hi> But this he takes no notice of, but proceeds to cover himſelf with his former Falſhoods and Reiterations of Matters already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>To make his <hi>Independent</hi> Cauſe ſeem very credible, he gives
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93229:2"/> us this proffer, <hi>viz. If the</hi> Independents <hi>pleaſe to take cognizance of the Debate, I dare appeal to them,</hi> pag. 1. What a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hazard this man dares run! that he dares adventure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to his Own Party! It ſeems he has far more Confidence in them then they have in him, in that hitherto they dare not ſo far truſt him as to allow him a Deputation, or vindicate his Work in Print, he is left to ſhift for himſelf; only he would make us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he has them all on his ſide, becauſe of his owning their <hi>Savoy Confeſſion,</hi> whenas he has writ far more againſt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> then that comes to in his ſeveral Books and Pamphlets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many falſe Doctrines, Contradictions, Slanders, Abuſes and Perverſions, which are not in that Confeſſion; and had he not perſiſted therein, we might have forborn farther taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof; but we muſt yet ſhew what a bad Cauſe his is, that needs Lyes and Slanders for its Refuge.</p>
            <p>And now again, as to ſome of thoſe horrid Falſhoods and Blaſphemies which he moſt falſly ſaith <hi>Are the Quakers Doctrines,</hi> whereof he ſaith, <hi>Three are cull'd out of Thirteen, ſo that Ten remain upon us ſtill,</hi> pag. 2. as if we granted all we have not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which alſo is an implicit Untruth; for we plainly tell him (after the citation of a few of his Slanders and Reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) viz. <q rend="margSglQuotes">Theſe, with many more Slanders and Revilings are diſperſt throughout W. H's laſt Book;</q> ſee <hi>Independent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> p. 3.</p>
            <p>The firſt of the three that he ſayes are the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrines, is, <hi>That the Ordinances of the Goſpel are vain and ceaſed.</hi> This being denyed, he quotes <hi>William Penn</hi> thus, viz. <q rend="margSglQuotes">I affirm, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is as much in force as Water-Baptiſm, and the Paſcal Lamb as Bread and Wine—the Appellation Ordinances of Chriſt I therefore Renounce as—Inevangelical—they are—not now required, </q>
               <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing,</hi> pag. 108, 109. From whence this <hi>Independent</hi> Agent concludes, viz. <hi>There is Proof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the</hi> Quakers <hi>Doctrine is, that the Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are vain and ceaſed.</hi> Wherein his Charge and Inference is ſtill falſe, even as to matter of fact; as if the <hi>Quakers</hi> did ſo teach concerning what are really the Ordinances of the Goſpel; which is a falſly begging the Queſtion. W. P. believes not that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93229:3"/> Water-Baptiſm and Bread and Wine, practiſed by the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> &amp;c. (againſt whom he was writing) to be Ordinances of Chriſt, or now required; he does not ſay, that the Ordinances of the Goſpel or of Chriſt are vain and ceaſed, but only that theſe are not ſuch. See now how W. H. has plainly belyed the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. His ſecond Doctrine charged upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> is, <hi>That it was the</hi> s <hi>Devil that ſuffered without the Gates, &amp;c.</hi> for proof he brings u this Certificate, viz.</p>

            <p>See now, Reader, how we have traced and evidently detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>William Craven</hi> in his Certificate, and found him falſe in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to his own and his Abettor <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s utter Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; for publiſhing ſuch a malicious Slander againſt <hi>James Naylor,</hi> as that <hi>Mary was a Whore, and Chriſt was a Baſtard;</hi> and <hi>W.

            <p>And now to conclude, we have this further to add, appealing to our more moderate Neighbours in <hi>Hertford,</hi> who have known us many years, whether they ever apprehended us to be of ſo Unchriſtian Practices in our Converſation; for if there be ſuch Antichriſtian Principles and Blaſphemous Tenents held and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by us (as <hi>William Haworth</hi> and his Adherents have wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcandalized us withal) they would ſometime or other break forth into Unſavoury and Antichriſtian Practices (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>By their Fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> But it doth moſt evidently appear now what the drift of W. H. and his Accomplices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93229:6"/> in their ſcribling and conteſting againſt us, that by writing and aſſerting Lyes they may render us as odious as may be (not only to get <hi>our Neſt at</hi> Hertford (as he calls it) <hi>broken up</hi> (which W. H. ſaith, <hi>its high time it were)</hi> but alſo (as much as in him lies) to render us ſuch as aſſert Blaſphemous Principles (becauſe he hath gotten ſome Forgers to witneſs it againſt one or two Perſons (all which is deny'd) that ſo our Lives and Eſtates might be indanger'd through their Malice, by caſting that upon many which is unqueſtionably falſe concerning any one, as by what hath been before ſaid doth more fully appear.</p>
            <p>And as for our Principles, we are ſtill ready by the Lord's aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to maintain them by Scripture and otherwiſe in Print and Teſtimony to all ingenuous and impartial Perſons: but it ſeems evident it is, our Deſtruction he longs for, or otherwiſe he would not print ſuch horrible Lyes of us: Oh Wicked Wretch!</p>

            <p>Alſo in his Vindication and Anſwer upon his Examination at the Seſſions at <hi>Appleby,</hi> in the 11th moneth, 1652. in the Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Saul's Errand,</hi> pag. 25. <q rend="margDblQuotes">Chriſt is not divided, if he be, he is no more Chriſt: I witneſs that Chriſt who is God and Man, &amp;c.</q>—ſeperate God and Man and he is no more Chriſt, pag. 31. <q rend="margDblQuotes">I own no other Chriſt but he who witneſſed a good Confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>

            <p>His Allegation for his ſaying, That theſe are the <hi>Quakers</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, viz. [<hi>That it was the Devil that ſuffered without the Gates; and that</hi> Mary <hi>was a Whore, and Chriſt a Baſtard</hi>] runs thus, viz. <hi>'Tis enough for me to call thoſe things of a Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which any</hi> Quaker <hi>writes or aſſerts in diſcourſe Doctrines, while they all pretend alwayes to be guided by one infallible Teacher, the Light Within,</hi> p. 3.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93229:7"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> That any <hi>Quaker</hi> hath writ or aſſerted ſuch Doctrine we find not; but the contrary (as before hinted) and look on't as meer Malice and Baſeneſs ſo to accuſe them.</p>
            <p>2. Set Caſe any one had ſo writ or aſſerted, it follows not that the whole People are chargeable therewith [as the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrines without exception] that's no good Conſequence nor natural inference from their all pretending to be guided by the ſame infallible Teacher, the <hi>Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See what a rare <hi>Logician</hi> this man is! Either the Light within muſt be chargeable with ſuch Doctrine againſt Chriſt and <hi>Mary,</hi> as before, or elſe all the Profeſſors of it, becauſe ſome pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, have (if he ſayes true) ſo diſcourſed. What groſs Fallacy and falſe Logick is this! Whereas ſuch an Abſurdity was never the Aſſertion of the People called <hi>Quakers, viz.</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every one pretending to be guided by the Light Within, on diſtinguiſh't by the Name [<hi>Quaker</hi>] is therefore guided by the ſame Light in all Diſcourſes, or ſo to be owned by the ſaid People. Therefore his general Inference is ſilly and groundleſs, as well as unjuſt and Fallacious. Would the <hi>Independent</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations be thus argu'd againſt, as to be thus univerſally char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with all the Private Opinions or Diſcourſes of every <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> becauſe they all pretend the holy Scriptures to be the Rule, as well as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do the Light of Chriſt within?

            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> Theſe, which are ſome of <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s Doctrines; may be charged on all the Independents, <hi>viz. That [God] the Father poured out all his Wrath upon his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               </gap>ut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his fallacious Attempts, to faſten theſe fore-cited Doctrines upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> (concerning the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Chriſt) like a hardned wilful Perſon, having a Conſcience ſeared. He perſiſts in his general Accuſations and Slanders upon Reports againſt that ſolemn Atteſtation that we have given to the contrary, in anſwer to thoſe things before, which he has aſſerted to be the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrines, where we have ſaid, viz. <q rend="margSglQuotes">To all which in the Sight and Preſence of the holy God we anſwer, We are certain that 'tis an abominable Slander in that General Charge upon the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and he hath moſt infamouſly abuſed us in this matter, in ſaying, <hi>Theſe are the</hi> Quakers <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which we teſtifie againſt as ſo groſs and abominable that nothing like them hath entred into our Hearts ever to imagine, Much leſs to preach for Doctrine, as, <hi>That it was the Devil that ſuffered without the Gates; and that</hi> Mary <hi>was a Whore, and Chriſt a Baſtard.</hi> And yet he tells the World, <hi>Theſe are the</hi> Quakers <hi>Doctrines.</hi> What abominable Wickedneſs is this! thus to make infamous a People who abhor ſuch Blaſphemy,</q> pag. 2. of our ſheet <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears that this <hi>Independent</hi> Preacher had not the Modeſty to tell the World, that ſuch and ſuch things are reported of ſome among the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but ſuch lying Reports as he has againſt us, he both eſpouſeth and aſſerts them poſitively, as, <hi>Theſe are the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>Doctrines, their Blaſphemies;</hi> not theſe are reported to have been diſcourſed by ſome among them. Thus the man's Out-rage, Malice and Revenge exceeds all Bounds of common Reaſon, Civility or Humanity, as if he were mad againſt us, and envyed not only our being at <hi>Hertford</hi> (wiſhing that <hi>our Neſt</hi> at <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93229:8"/> were broke up, as his words are) but even our Proſperity and Being (as a People) upon Earth, <hi>as deſerving to be ſtoned to Death by the Righteous Law of God, if it were in force,</hi> pag. 3. But 'tis much if he and his Accomplices and Abettors be not made aſhamed of his Malice and Out-rage ere we have done with him, if he will not ſtudy Quietneſs among his Neighbours, not doubting but God who is with us will rebuke his Baſeneſs and Malice againſt us; who having falſly accuſed us from malicious and falſe Reports of others, Suſpitions and Jealouſies of his own, proceeds thus, viz.</p>
            <p>W. Haworth, <hi>My Thoughts are, That the</hi> Quakers <hi>no more believe Chriſt to be a real Man in Heaven, then I believe there is a Man in the Moon,</hi> pag. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> No wonder he ſhould harbour Evil and Unbelieving Thoughts of us, and what we have confeſſed to Chriſt's real and moſt glorious Manhood in the Heavens, ſince he is ſo apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, aſſert and ſpread lying Reports and Slanders againſt us for Truths, if it were poſſible to deſtroy us from off the Face of the Earth: Such as are given up to believe and aſſert Lyes, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe and oppoſe the Truth: He would have us appear bad, and therefore hee'l believe no good of us. But why thinks he the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not believe Chriſt to be a real Man? His main and frequent Reaſon is, he ſaith, <hi>We ſay that the Soul of Chriſt is in every Saint, and that his Body is changed as to ſubſtance,</hi> pag. 5, and 7. of his Sheet. For the firſt he quotes the 6th page of our <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> where we confeſs Chriſt's Spiritual Preſence with his Saints, which he dares not deny, he having confeſſed Chriſt's Soul to be his Spirit from <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 46. in his <hi>Antidote,</hi> and we have oppoſed his arguing againſt the extent of Chriſt's Soul (or Spirit) to the Saints on Earth, ſeeing he is both God and Man; his Soul or Spirit, even as Man, as Mediator, virtually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually (through his divine Power and Authority) extends and reaches to the Saints on Earth; and at length he is made to grant, that <hi>the Man Chriſt is virtually preſent on Earth,</hi> in his Book <hi>Jeſ. of Naz.</hi> p. 20. l. 7. <hi>But how can this be, that Chriſt's Soul ſhould be in the Saints on Earth? for then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and turned into a New God,</hi> pag. 5. of his Anſwer.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93229:9"/> Whereas it is virtually in the Saints, through the Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Father, being both God and Man, without deſtroying, annihilating or confounding the <hi>Properties of the Manhood with the Deity,</hi> or <hi>leaving his Body dead in Heaven,</hi> as has been moſt vainly argu'd by this <hi>Independent;</hi> for does the Virtue of the Vine in the Branches and Fruit leave the Vine or Root empty and dead, becauſe it extends to every Branch?</p>
            <p>Beſides his own Confeſſion, viz. <hi>That the Deity perfects all good</hi> IN US, <hi>but then the Humanity is in union with it, and</hi> ACTS <hi>with it, and they muſt not be put aſſunder;</hi> and that <hi>the Deity acts in it and through it as an Organ or Inſtrument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What's more plain, then that the Deity &amp; Manhood of Chriſt do act together in Union in perfecting all good in us? Does not then the Soul of Chriſt extend to the Saints on Earth? When will this Adverſary ſee how he is ſelf-condemned and confuted! For do the Deity and Manhood of Chriſt together act and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all Good IN US, and yet his Soul have no place in us, nor ſo much as extend to us? And what though the Manhood does not extend ſo far as the Deity, which is infinite, is it a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that therefore it cannot extend to Saints or Men on Earth? Are they ſo infinitely remote from the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus their Head? But his Inferences and Arguing againſt us in this matter is like his concluding, <hi>that we deny the Manhood of Chriſt,</hi> from our confeſſing to the Change, Spirituality, and Glory of his Body, and the powerful extent of his Soul, and ſpiritual Preſence to and in the Saints on Earth, which does not at all leſſen the ſubſtantial Dignity, but exalt it; ſo that inſtead of denying or diſſannulling the Man Chriſt Jeſus, we magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him more then <hi>William Haworth</hi> allows of, that is the ☞ Caſe.</p>
            <p>One great Exception that lies heavy upon our Adverſary <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Haworth</hi>'s Argument, and which he gets not off nor anſwers, is his confeſſing <hi>Satan to be an Angel, yet but a Creature;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>that he is here on Earth to tempt the Saints becauſe he is not yet bound in Hell,</hi> pag. 36. of his <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> So that ſtill he allows Satan more Power to tempt the Saints (though in many places at once far diſtant) then the Man Chriſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93229:9"/> to relieve them, though he be their Mediator and Head, and is touched with the feeling of their Infirmities, and ſuccours them that are tempted, and has promiſed to be with his Diſciples to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>But ſays <hi>William Haworth, It is the Will of God, that Satan ſhould yet be here on Earth to tempt the Saints, he is not yet bound up in Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then! is it the Will of God, that the heavenly MAN Chriſt Jeſus (who is the Son of God) ſhould remain bound in Heaven, ſo as not to viſit and relieve his Saints or Members on Earth; nor his Soul or Spirit ſo much as extend to them? Has Satan more Liberty and Priviledge given him of God then his dear Son Chriſt Jeſus has? Oh miſerable and uncomfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine!</p>
            <p>To his arguing, <hi>That the Soul of Chriſt cannot be in Millions Myriads of places, no not in two places at once; for then it would be immenſe, turned into a New God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has argued better for Satan then thus. Is Satan immenſe then? He has placed Satan's Liberty to tempt the Saints on Earth and limiting Chriſt to Heaven (the mean while) upon the <hi>Will of God, Jeſ. Naz.</hi> pag. 36. ſo that his Plea of Chriſt's Soul or Manhood not being God or immenſe is now removed as no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument either to prove it in no wiſe IN the Saints, or not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to them on Earth; ſeeing Satan himſelf reacheth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at once; and Chriſt Jeſus is above and greater then he. And ſure the Will of God is more eminently concerned in Chriſt the Mediator, for the Good of Mankind, and the Conſolation of the Saints in their Tryals, then in Satan's tempting them. And ſeeing we have alwayes believed and confeſſed the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and intire Beings of the Souls of all other Men, it muſt needs be evidently unjuſt to accuſe us with <hi>denying the Manhood of Chriſt, or</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>to have a Being both as to his Soul and Body,</hi> as this Adverſary has frequently inſinuated.</p>
            <p>And as for Chriſt's Body being changed, <hi>as to ſubſtance,</hi> which he often infers upon us, from our arguing againſt his aſſerting Chriſt's Body (in Heaven) <hi>to be a Natural Body, of an Earthly Subſtance.</hi> The Terms <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Earthly,</hi> as given to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93229:10"/> Glorious Body of Chriſt were and are offenſive to us, as well as contrary to his own confeſſing, <hi>that it is ſuch a Glorious Body, that it is more bright then a Thouſand Suns.</hi> So that then it muſt needs be a very glorious heavenly Body, which ſure is not the ſame with Earthly (neither is Natural and Spiritual both one quality.) And we believing ſuch a Change in the Body of Chriſt, we do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (nor ever did) conclude, that the Body of Chriſt which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was annihilated, and that his Fleſh ſaw Corruption. No ſuch matter. May there not then be a wonderful Change in the Body, and yet the Subſtance not annihilated nor deſtroyed? Nor does it follow from our not believing nor owning his Characters of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>Earthly</hi> on Chriſt's Glorious Body, that therefore nothing of that Body remains, or is in being, as he falſly and frequently argues in his Books. For he has confeſſed, <hi>Chriſt hath a Glorious Body, and all the Saints ſhall have like Bodies,</hi> Phil. 3. ult. <hi>And that both his is, and theirs will be spiritual, heavenly, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for Qualities,</hi> pag. 29. of his <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> And grants it <hi>Angelical, Spiritual, Celeſtial as to Qualities,</hi> pag. 31. ibid.</p>
            <p>If SPIRITUAL, and HEAVENLY or CELESTIAL, &amp;c. be Qualities, then NATURAL, and EARTHLY, and CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL are Qualities alſo. And if we muſt believe our <hi>Adverſary</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Chriſt's Body in Heaven is very glorious, ſpiritual and heavenly for Qualities, yea, brighter then a Thouſand Suns,</hi> then we muſt not believe him where he ſays, <hi>'tis natural, earthly, &amp;c.</hi> which are contrary to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly.</hi> If hee'l yet infer, that then there's <hi>nothing</hi> of the Subſtance in being, we deny his Inference, it being alſo contrary to his own Confeſſion, viz. <hi>That the ſame Subſtance remains:</hi> ſo that it may be ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully changed as to Qualities, and yet the Subſtance neither deſtroyed, loſt, or nullified.</p>
            <p>But to wave many more of <hi>W. Haworth</hi>'s Untruths and falſe Conſequences in his Books and Sheet, take two or three Inſtances of his Falſhoods and Forgeries, which are very obvious in matter of fact, in the 6th and 7th pages of his Sheet touching Chriſt's Aſcention, where he ſays, that <hi>When we ſay, the ſame man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, by aſcending into HEAVEN</hi> (he ſays) <hi>we mean the</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93229:10"/> 
               <hi>Globe which we call the EARTH:</hi> Which is all one as to ſay, that by <hi>HEAVEN</hi> we mean <hi>EARTH.</hi> For proof of this notorious and moſt abſurd Falſhood he refers the Reader to the 16th page of his laſt, and ſaith, <hi>According to our Principle there was nothing of the Man Chriſt to aſcend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if we allowed <hi>nothing</hi> of the Man Chriſt, either of Spirit or Body to have a Being (after his Reſurrection) to aſcend; a moſt horrid Falſhood brought to prove another ſuch as his Book and Page quoted is ſtufft with. His pretended Reaſon is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elſe-where in this, viz. <hi>If the Body was changed as to Subſtance, &amp;c.</hi> For though it was changed, and become more excellent, refined and glorious in the Subſtance, it follows not that 'twas annihilated.</p>
            <p>He addeth, <hi>And the humane Soul Immenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Falſhood ſtill impoſed on us in his own Unſcriptural Phraſe. Though Chriſt be God and Man in a moſt glorious U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power, yet the Manhood is not the Deity, nor the Deity the Manhood, yet inſeparable in the Heavenly Man Chriſt, who is Lord from Heaven.</p>
            <p>W. H. ſaith, <hi>He remembers one of</hi> G. Fox<hi>'s Interpretations, that when 'tis ſaid, he took upon him the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>that Seed was the Light within.</hi> On this we asked, Where does <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> ſo interpret that Scripture? we do not believe he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſo. <hi>William Haworth</hi> gives us this anſwer, viz. <hi>I did not ſay, I received it in his Books, but I Remember, &amp;c. I have heard it, and from good hands, whether they have heard it from his Mouth, or read it in his Books, I know not—I do believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Obſerve how wonderful Credulous this man's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice makes him againſt us, to make a direct Charge from a Report, viz. That he <hi>remembers</hi> that it was <hi>one</hi> of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Interpretations on the Scripture cited. But now he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he hath <hi>heard it ſo REIORTED,</hi> and he does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. One while, he remembers it was <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>'s Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; another while, he believes it, as having had it from other Hands, but whoſe Hands he tells us not, that we may know or enquire how good: it is greatly to be queſtioned, whether
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93229:11"/> he has not herein belyed good Hands to cover his Lye againſt G. F. and us. But to ſupport his Credit in this matter, he bids us, <hi>Hear</hi> Naylor <hi>interpret this thing in the very ſame way,</hi> Love to the Loſt, <hi>Preface, viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="margDblQuotes">So to the Light within—makes for the gathering Creatures together, to that one Name and Seed wherein all the Nations of the Earth are bleſſed.</q> Do but ſee how hard the man's put to it for a Proof to ſave his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But how much beſides the Point in two reſpects, <hi>1ſt,</hi> as to the Perſon; <hi>2dly,</hi> as to the Thing: for <hi>1ſt, James Naylor</hi> is not <hi>G. Fox. 2dly,</hi> The Light of Chriſt within (or what proceeds from him the Root) making for the gathering Creatures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that one Name and Seed, wherein the Nations are bleſſed, is not the ſame with ſaying, <hi>That Seed</hi>

               <hi>of</hi> Abraham, <hi>which according to the Fleſh Chriſt took upon him, was the Light within;</hi> nor either of them the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of that Scripture. For that Name and Seed wherein Nations are bleſſed, is Chriſt himſelf. Not that the Fleſhly Seed (taken by Chriſt) was the Light within. How miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hath this Adverſary come off! <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem.</hi>

            <p>Alſo, where <hi>William Haworth</hi> accuſeth the <hi>Quakers;</hi> Now to ſay, <hi>That what</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith in</hi> Rom. 4. 6. <hi>is contrary to what</hi> David <hi>ſaith in</hi> Pſal. 32. 2. For this he quoteth the eighth page of our <hi>Vindication,</hi> Doct. 11. with this addition, viz. <hi>They cite the words of</hi> Romans 4. 6. <hi>and then ſay contrary to</hi> Pſalm 32. 2. <hi>Thus</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>they ſet one Scripture againſt another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here he has committed an abominable Falſhood twice over; <hi>1ſt,</hi> in his <hi>Jeſ. Naz.</hi> pag. 8, 9. and <hi>2dly,</hi> in his Sheet. For in our <hi>Vindication</hi> there is no ſuch thing, as that <hi>what</hi> Paul <hi>ſayes,</hi> Rom. 4. 6. <hi>is contrary to</hi> Pſal. 32. 2. Neither do we ſay, that theſe words cited <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. are contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2. Nor yet do we ſet one Scripture againſt another, as he has moſt falſly accuſed us, but his own falſe Expoſition and Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Paul</hi>'s word; in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. 2, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. As where <hi>David</hi> deſcribes the Bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works. <hi>What Works,</hi> ſayes <hi>William Haworth?</hi> and then anſwers, <hi>Done</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93229:11"/> 
               <hi>by the Spirit ſurely; for ſuch were</hi> David<hi>'s Works:</hi> ſee his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi> page 18. line 25. Whereas 'twas not <hi>David</hi>'s words, but theſe laſt words of <hi>William Haworth,</hi> viz. [<hi>DONE BY THE SPIRIT S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RELY</hi>] (theſe were ſhewed by great Characters) that we oppoſed to <hi>David</hi>'s words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2. As to ſay, <hi>That God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works done by the Spirit;</hi> this we affirm is contrary to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. 2. where the bleſſed Qualification of that man unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity is intimated, viz. <hi>in whoſe Spirit there is NO Guile.</hi> Now a man's Spirit can neither be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nor clear from Guile without the Work of the Spirit of God. Therefore to ſay that a man is imputatively Righteous or bleſſed of God, <hi>without any Works done in him by his Spirit,</hi> is erroneous, and directly contrary to <hi>David</hi>'s Teſtimony in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> cited; See now where the Contradiction is evidently placed by us. 'Tis between <hi>W. Haworth</hi> and the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and not between the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s Forgeries is, that <hi>William Bates</hi> ſaith, He is ONLY SORRY <hi>for his Weakneſs and Over-ſight in giving him any ſuch Anſwer.</hi> We told him, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth [<hi>Only Sorry</hi>] and makes himſelf work on this Lye. To come off with an Excuſe here, he tells us, <hi>The word</hi> [ONLY] <hi>the Printer ſhould have put into another Character.</hi> As if another Character would make that true which is an apparent Lye, as in his ſaying, <hi>That</hi> William Bates <hi>(in his Retractation) ſaith, he is only ſorry,</hi> &amp;c. for 'twas none of his ſaying, nor ſenſe of all he ſays in his Retractation; and neither conſiſt in the Emphaſis which a different Character may ſhew. And <hi>William Haworth</hi> does not at all amend his matter, by ſaying, that William Bates <hi>mentions not any more that he is ſorry for, but that he gave him ſuch an Anſwer; If for nothing elſe, for that only.</hi> Here he makes his own implicite Conſequence, to prove that <hi>William Bates</hi> ſaid that in his Retractation which he did not ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is ONLY SORRY, &amp;c. which words are not there. <hi>William Haworth</hi> is a Forger in this and many more things againſt us then as yet we divulged. Beſides, <hi>William Bates</hi> did not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93229:12"/> his Weakneſs in giving any ſuch Anſwer, as is cited in his Retractation; but alſo clears the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> from teaching or holding any ſuch thing to his Knowledge; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s Reproaching them on that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>as being No</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>but Seducers,</hi> &amp;c. which with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Falſe Aſperſions he has caſt upon us.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That Fleſh ſaw no Corruption, but was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 31. Chriſt did riſe in that Body wherein he ſuffered, and in the ſame aſcended into the Heavens, where the Patriarch <hi>David</hi> did not, as to his B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dy, which was in the Sepulchre, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 29, to ver. 36. And that very Body of Chriſt which was rais'd from the dead, or that fleſh which ſaw no Corruption, how ſhould it but be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? <note n="‖" place="margin">In our Teſtimony for the Man Chriſt, pag. 7. we plainly told him our Belief, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="margDblQuotes">That the Man Chriſt did neither vaniſh nor periſh in any thing eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to him, either as to his Soul, Spirit or Body.</q>
               </note> (that is, in that Spiritual Senſe we have given) ſeeing he dyed not again,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93229:13"/> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9, Knowing Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dyeth no more, Death hath no more dominion over him; his dying was only as to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he was put to death as concerning the Fleſh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fleſh was raiſed from the dead. [<hi>Circumſcribed</hi>] It is ſo far circumſcribed or encompaſſed in the Heavens as 'tis capable of, and as is proper to it; and though it be ſpiritual and glorious, yet <hi>a Body,</hi> therefore not in every place where God is. [And as he has told us, <hi>It is not limited or confined to any one place or corner (as it were) of Heaven.]</hi> To be Omnipreſent is only proper to God, and not to Bodies.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How do they but deny the Manhood of Chriſt, that ſay, the Body of Jeſus is changed as to Subſtance, and his Soul is in every Saint?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1ſt,</hi> They do not deny the Manhood of Chriſt that ſay his Body is ſo changed, as to the quality and glory of it, that it is a ſpiritual, heavenly and glorious Body, in a higher ſtate then when on Earth under Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: this is no annihilating of the Body. <hi>2dly,</hi> That his Soul doth powerfully extend to, and is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint in ſome ſenſe and degree; this muſt needs be, if it <hi>act together in union with the Deity in perfecting all good in us,</hi> as our Adverſary has coufeſſed; as alſo, <hi>that it is virtually in the Saints</hi> Though we grant that it is in more fulneſs in himſelf then in us, yet of his fulneſs we have all received.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>They own they ſay the real Birth, Suffering and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt; but do they own bis Interceſſion in his Manhood as an High Prieſt in Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, we do. He is entred into Heaven it ſelf to appear in the Face of God for us; yet not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluſively out of the Saints. For this High Prieſt,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93229:13"/> who is ſet on the Right Hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens, is a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle which is with men, even with ſuch whoſe Miniſter &amp; Leader Chriſt is. And God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our Hearts, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. The Spirit makes interceſſion with Sighs and Groans, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>W. H. <hi>So that as man he is not materially here on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> An impertinent and fallacious Addition, if he own him not as man in any ſenſe on Earth. For doth not this imply, that as Man he is immaterially on earth. If by <hi>materially</hi> he means he is not corporally on earth, as in the dayes of his Fleſh, we grant it. But then we may not deny his being on Earth Spiritually and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as Man, he being the ſpiritual and heavenly Man, the Lord FROM Heaven, and a quickening Spirit. Elſe how are any on Earth quickened by him? And how did he walk in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ſticks, which were the ſeven Churches? <hi>Rev</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>W. H. <hi>Theſe are Scripture words,</hi> Acts 3. 21. <hi>Whom the Heaven muſt receive (or contein, the reading will bear it) until the time of the reſtitution of all things. Is not that [whom] the Man Chriſt? His Deity cannot be conteined any where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1ſt,</hi> Whom the Heaven muſt receive or take, it is not <hi>contein</hi> nor <hi>retein:</hi> and ſometimes Heaven in the New Teſtament-Scriptures is put for God himſelf. 2. It is [times] in the plural, <hi>viz.</hi> whom Heaven (chiefly reſpecting God that dwells therein) muſt receive or take until the <hi>times</hi> of the reſtitution (which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or reformation) of all things, ſpoken by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets. Thoſe times are the Goſpel times, and the laſt dayes, wherein God is making good his Promiſe of the Bleſſing in Chriſt to all Nations, in turning every
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93229:14"/> man that receives him from Iniquity, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26 So that now the laſt <hi>Adam</hi> or ſecond Man is revealed from Heaven, and known to be a quickening Spirit, and the Lord FROM Heaven. That [<hi>whom</hi>] was Jeſus Chriſt, the Heavenly Man, whom Heaven received into Glory, into a more hidden condition (when the Earth had contemned and rejected him) until thoſe more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious times of his Out-goings and Diſcoveries in the latter dayes, for the gathering of Nations and Peoples, and bleſſing them, in turning them from their Iniquities. And though thoſe Times of Reſtitution are begun, he who is the Reſtorer ſhall yet more fully and univerſally appear for the accompliſhment of that his Work.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is not Heaven a place remote from the Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Heaven is higher then the Earth, and ſo diſtinct or remote. But there is a plurality of Heavens; ſome more near, and ſome more remote: as alſo ſpiritual Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as well as natural.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is not Conteining Circumſcribing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What's contein'd within the compaſs or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of place, more or leſs, may be ſaid to be circumſcribed.</p>
            <p>W. H. <hi>So that as man he is not on Earth locally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why is [<hi>locally</hi>] added? In what other ſenſe then locally is Chriſt as man on earth? Is he not on earth ſpiritually as a <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> being the Lord from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? even that man by whom came the Reſurrection of the dead? who quickens whom he will? If in no ſenſe this ſecond man appear on Earth, how are any quickned by him?</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is that Reſtitution of all things fulfilled; or yet to come? anſwer plainly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Reſtitution of all things, ſpoken by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93229:14"/> Mouth of all God's Prophets is not wholly fulfilled. But both the times thereof are begun, and Jeſus Chriſt is about and carrying on the work of reſtitution fore-told. The Deliverer is come out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the Reſtorer of Paths to dwell in is come; he is on his way: And he will yet more fully and gloriouſly appear to fulfil the Promiſes ſpoken of him.</p>
            <p>W. H. Obj. <hi>But belike they have a notion, which in time they will ſpeak out, That Chriſt was Man before he was a Man, i. e. (which</hi> Penington <hi>ſaith) heavenly Fleſh, Blood and Bones came down from Heaven, and tabernacled in that Body; That was the Man Chriſt that came into the Man Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether he has rightly cited <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi> in all theſe words or no, is ſome queſtion. What Book and Page of his they are to be found in, he tells us not. That <hi>I. P.</hi> in ſome Queſtions hath diſtinguiſhed between that Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt which came down from Heaven (which is meat and drink indeed, of an inward, ſpiritual &amp; eternal nature) and the Body, Fleſh or Vail, that was prepared for him, is true. And what has our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to ſay to this? Does it thence follow, that Chriſt was man before he was a man? or that there are two man Chriſts, one that came into the other? what abſurd Nonſenſe would this man brand us withal? might not Chriſt the Son of God be the heavenly man, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, before he took upon him the Body that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him? which is not a being man before he was a man, but before he was ſo inveſted, or came into that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Surely his ſaying, <hi>A Body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10. 5. does not make him two man Chriſts.</p>
